Description: optimized link-state routing daemon (unik-olsrd)
 unik-olsrd is an implementation of the Optimized Link State Routing protocol
 for Mobile Ad-Hoc networks(MANET). The protocol is described in RFC3626. It
 is designed to be run as a standalone server process.
 .
 OLSR operates as a table driven, proactive protocol, i.e., it exchanges
 topology information with other nodes of the network regularly. It is
 developed to work independently from other protocols. Likewise, OLSR makes no
 assumptions about the underlying link-layer.

Description: various plugins to enhance olsrd
 olsrd is an implementation of the Optimized Link State Routing protocol
 for Mobile Ad-Hoc networks(MANET)
 .
 The following plugins are available:
 .
  * httpinfo      - tiny webserver for information purposes
  * dyn_gw        - dynamically announce uplinks
  * dot_draw      - generates output (over a TCP socket) in the dot format
  * secure        - secure OLSR routing with a shared key
  * nameservice   - announce hostnames and dns servers
  * bmf           - basic multicast forwarding
  * quagga        - import external routes from quagga
  * txtinfo       - display information about the OSLR node
 .
 The following plugins are also included, even though experimental and demo
 plugins:
 .
  * pgraph        - performance graph
  * watchdog      - detection of olsrd freeze
  * tas           - tiny application server
  * mini          - minimal example plugin (demo)
  * dyn_gw_plain  - dyn_gw without ping/libthread
  * arprefresh    - optimize kernel arp cache from olsr UDP sniffing
  * mdnsp         - multicast DNS via OLSR mesh network
  * p2pd          - distribute P2P Discovery messages
